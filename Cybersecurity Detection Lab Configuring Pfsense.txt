Built My PC, ages ago. Recent Additions are 1TB HDD from old desktop with SDD,  Swapped out 8GB RAM to 32GB
Installing Pfsense
Configured as a firewall to segment our private homelab network and will only be accessible from my Kali Linux Machine
2GB Ram for memory 
Made 6 Network Adapters and set all of them to custom specific virtual networks (Vmnet 1-6)
Assigned IP addresses for the network for the other virtual machines in the lab
Set the interface IP addresses to other Vm’s in the lab
Option 2 (Set Interfaces IP) Started with WAN and LAN
Left the OPT3 Interface without an Ip because it is going to have the span port with traffic that Security Onion will be monitoring from my victim network
