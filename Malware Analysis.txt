Download virtualBox or use anyform of virtualization you are comfortable with
//I did the setup in Vmware, then switched to virtualbox for convenience sake since the teacher is using virtualbox, and wanted to setup on both.

Download windows 10
>Setup windows 10 VM

Download REMnux
>setup remnux (also do VM tools)

Download FlareVM
Install FlareVM (install.ps1) "./install.ps1" (took a long time to download, make sure to check if anything failed to download, go to the site of the tool and download)

Set up network to host only -> this ensures an isolated network (If I want to go back to connected to my host, snapshot to a safe instance with no malware detonated & connect to NAT)

Download The malware we will analyze from github (They are zipped,and password protected, and made into a non-executable file) 

To make it executable, remove the end "malz."

sha256.exe, md5sum.exe file to get the hash

Use the hash on virtustotal to see if it matches anything, and will be able to tell if the file is malicious or what type of malware it is.
